        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a student game developer. I started developing games in 2020 as my love of games took me to the next level. 
            I have completed my NC and HNC Game Development courses and I am currently working towards my HND in game development at Edinburgh College. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This career step happened as I have been playing games for over 25 years and always wanted to create my own game. I have experience in different aspects of game development, 
            although programming is where I have the most experience. Other areas that I have experience in are:

                </tr>

            </table>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I have experience working in a few different programs. Most of my experiences lies within Visual Studio using Monogame. I am also very proficient using Unity.
            I also have experience working with Unreal Engine and Blueprint coding.
        </p>
    
        <p>I love to create games that people can get lost in.</p>

                In this game I took inspiration from the classic games Snake and BomberMan<br> 
                <br>
                Each player controls a snake that can eat food to grow and pick up bombs<br> to 
                blow up  the breakable walls or the other snake.
                <br>
                <br>
                The last player left in the game is the winner.

                    The player has to shoot the enemies to stop
                    them getting to the left hand side of the screen.
