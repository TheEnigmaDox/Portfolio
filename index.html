    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a student game developer. I started developing games during covid as my love of games took me to the next level. 
        I have completed my NC and HNC Game Development courses and I am currently working towards my HND in game development at Edinburgh College. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This career step happened as I have been playing games for over 25 years and always wanted to create my own game. I have experience in different aspects of game development, 
        although programming is where I have the most experience. Other areas that I have experience in are:

    <p>
        I have experience working in a few different programs. Most of my experiences lies within Visual Studio using Monogame. I am also very proficient using Unity.
        I also have experience working with Unreal Engine and Blueprint coding.
    </p>

    <p>I love to create games that people can get lost in.</p>
